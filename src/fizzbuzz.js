// Inside the `src/fizzbuzz.js` file, write a program that populates the `answer` array with numbers from 1 to 15, *except*:

// - When the number is a multiple of three (e.g. 3, 6, 9, etc.), the number should be replaced with the word `Fizz`

// - When the number is a multiple of five (e.g. 5, 10, etc.), the number should be replaced with the word `Buzz`

// - When the number is a multiple of both three *and* five (e.g. 15), the number should be replaced with the word `FizzBuzz`

const answer = []

// Write your code below this line

for (i = 0; i <= 15; i++) {
  // fizzbuzz for multiple of 3 and 5
  // if (i = math. )
  answer.push(i)
}
// fizz for multiple of 3
// buzz for multiple of 5
console.log(answer)
// Don't touch the code below this line, we'll cover it later
